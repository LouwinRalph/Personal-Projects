# 1Ô∏è‚É£ PRINTING
# ‚û§ What: Displays output to the console.
# ‚û§ Why: Essential for debugging and user interaction.
print("Hello, World!")  # Prints a greeting message

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ VARIABLES & DATA TYPES
# ‚û§ What: Store data in memory using names.
# ‚û§ Why: Lets you reuse and manipulate values easily.
name = "Lou"         # String: text data
age = 25                # Integer: whole number
height = 1.1           # Float: decimal number
is_active = True        # Boolean: True or False
skills = ["Python", "HTML", "PHP", "JAVA"]  # List: collection of items

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
# ‚û§ What: Executes code based on conditions.
# ‚û§ Why: Adds logic and decision-making to programs.
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")  # Runs if age is greater than 18
elif age == 18:
    print("Just turned adult")  # Runs if age is exactly 18
else:
    print("Minor")  # Runs if age is less than 18

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ LOOPS
# ‚û§ What: Repeats code multiple times.
# ‚û§ Why: Useful for processing lists, automation, and repetition.

# For loop: iterates over items
for skill in skills:
    print("Skill:", skill)

# While loop: runs as long as condition is true
counter = 0
while counter < 3:
    print("Counter:", counter)
    counter += 1  # Increments counter

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ FUNCTIONS
# ‚û§ What: Blocks of reusable code.
# ‚û§ Why: Makes code organized and avoids repetition.
def greet(user):
    return f"Hello, {user}!"  # Returns a personalized greeting

print(greet(name))  # Calls the function with 'name'

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ LISTS (Arrays)
# ‚û§ What: Ordered collection of items.
# ‚û§ Why: Stores multiple values in one variable.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("mango")       # Adds item to list
print(fruits[0])             # Accesses first item
print(len(fruits))           # Gets number of items

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ DICTIONARIES
# ‚û§ What: Key-value pairs.
# ‚û§ Why: Great for storing structured data.
person = {
    "name": "Louwin",
    "age": 25,
    "location": "Imus"
}
print(person["location"])    # Accesses value by key

# 8Ô∏è‚É£ LOOPING WITH INDEX
# ‚û§ What: Combines loop with position tracking.
# ‚û§ Why: Useful when you need both item and its index.
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(f"Fruit {i}: {fruits[i]}")

# 9Ô∏è‚É£ EXCEPTION HANDLING
# ‚û§ What: Catches and handles errors.
# ‚û§ Why: Prevents program from crashing unexpectedly.
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will cause an error
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")  # Handles the error gracefully

# üîü CLASSES & OBJECTS
# ‚û§ What: Blueprint for creating objects (OOP).
# ‚û§ Why: Organizes code around real-world entities.
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade

    def display(self):
        print(f"{self.name} got grade {self.grade}")

s1 = Student("Louwin", "A")  # Creates a student object
s1.display()                 # Calls method to show info

# 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ IMPORTING MODULES
# ‚û§ What: Brings in external tools/functions.
# ‚û§ Why: Extends Python‚Äôs capabilities.
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Uses math module to get square root

# 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ FILE HANDLING
# ‚û§ What: Reads and writes files.
# ‚û§ Why: Useful for saving data or reading input.
with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a sample file.")  # Writes to file

# 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ LIST COMPREHENSION
# ‚û§ What: Short way to create lists.
# ‚û§ Why: Makes code cleaner and faster.
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]  # Creates list of squares
print(squares)

# 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ ENUMERATE
# ‚û§ What: Adds index to loop items.
# ‚û§ Why: Cleaner than using range(len(...)).
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
